#   then bring up the original segment pair to ensure that the new primary/master
#   is fully functional.
# We follow these steps:
# 1). add table/data to current master/primary
# 2). stop master/primary
# 3). wait for automatic failover(for downed primary) or explicitly promote standby(for downed master)
# 4). make sure data is on new master/primary
# -). prepare for 6: recoverseg to bring up old master/primary as standby/mirror
# 6). repeat 1-4 for new-old back to old-new
# NOTE: this method leaves the cluster without a standby-master
